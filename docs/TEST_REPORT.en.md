## 5. Subtitle Quality & Retry Tests
### 5.1 Observed Issues
| Issue type | Symptom | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Misalignment / shifted lines | Mid-segment line-to-time mismatch in some episodes | Fixed in detection/alignment logic; continued regression required |
| Missing translation at tail segments | Some ranges remained untranslated | Retry and reason logging improvements applied |
| High tail-retry overhead | Significant token increase | Root cause identified as `unchanged_source_and_protected` |

### 5.2 Quantitative Results (from runtime logs)
Source files:
- `D:\Projects\SubZ\tmp\latest-task-tail-retry-analysis.md`
- `D:\Projects\SubZ\tmp\last-6-files-tail-retry-analysis.md`
- `D:\Projects\SubZ\tmp\rebellious-women-season1-tail-retry-report.md`

Key metrics:
- Total tokens (latest 6 files): `423,880`
- Tail-retry tokens: `82,039` (`19.35%`)
- Dominant aggregated reason: `unchanged_source_and_protected = 1084`

Example (latest S01E02 task):
- Total tokens: `76,509`
- Tail-retry tokens: `9,557` (`12.49%`)
- Retry ranges: 5 ranges (with exact cue time windows)

## 6. Targeted Optimizations Completed (and Deployed)
| Optimization | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lower default temperature | Completed | Default `temperature` changed from `0.2` to `0.1` |
| Stronger base translation prompt | Completed | Enforced "must translate, no source copy-through, keep markers/count/order" |
| Specialized retry prompt for unchanged lines | Completed | Tail-retry switches to `RetryUnchanged` mode by failure reason |
| Enhanced retry observability | Completed | Logs now include reason summary, retry range, cue time window, prompt mode |

## 7. Security & Engineering Quality Review Summary
| Item | Result | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plaintext secret risk | Identified | Reminder issued: do not commit secret files under `tmp` |
| Retryability classification | Improved | Non-retryable exceptions are no longer retried blindly |
| God-class architecture risk | Identified | Refactor roadmap started; further decomposition needed |
| ffmpeg/ffprobe availability | Improved | Startup validation and explicit warning logs added |

## 8. Known Limitations & Pending Regression Items
| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Whether "pause then auto-resume" is fully eliminated | Requires more long-running task validation |
| Net quality/token gain from new prompt strategy | Needs new run data for before/after comparison |
| Stability across languages and source types (external/embedded) | Requires broader sample regression |
| OCR path (SUP -> OCR -> translation) | Not included in current execution pipeline |

## 9. Recommended Next Regression Round
1. Run 3 consecutive episodes from the same show and verify whether tail-retry ratio continues to decrease.
2. Compare playback consistency between `srt` and `ass` outputs.
3. Under high-load recursive folder runs, verify pause/resume/stop state transitions.
4. Compare performance and log volume with Debug mode on vs off.

## 10. Conclusion
SubZ currently has a production-ready baseline in deployment, execution, observability, and manual control.

At this stage, the main cost driver remains tail retries caused by unchanged lines. A dedicated prompt strategy has been implemented and deployed. The next real-run dataset will determine whether we should proceed with finer-grained selective resend strategies.

### 11.3 Exception / Warning Event Counters
Note: "exceptions" here include both hard failures and quality-warning events.

`subz-runtime-20260507.latest.log`:
- `HTTP non-200 responses`: `0`
- `Healing failed segments`: `35`
- `Retry range`: `65`
- `Marker mismatch detected in batch lines`: `23`
- `Marker mismatch detected in retry lines`: `4`
- `remain after retries` (still unresolved after retries): `1`

`subz-runtime-20260507.log`:
- `HTTP non-200 responses`: `0`
- `Healing failed segments`: `20`
- `Retry range`: `47`
- `Marker mismatch detected in batch lines`: `11`
- `Marker mismatch detected in retry lines`: `2`
- `remain after retries`: `0`

### 11.4 Data-backed Conclusions
- The dominant cost issue is not API transport failure (HTTP non-200 = 0), but frequent quality-recovery triggers (`unchanged` + marker mismatch).
- Latest 6-task tail-retry ratio is `19.35%`, lower than the historical `23.41%`, but still high.
- In the next round, validate whether the new specialized retry prompt for unchanged lines reduces `Healing failed segments` and `Retry range` counts.
